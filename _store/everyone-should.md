description: Everyone Should&nbsp;is a book and Twitter bot. Every hour, the bot finds
  the most recent tweet beginning with the words “everyone should” and retweets it.
  These messages are collected in the bot’s timeline, and in a large book designed
  in the form of a diary. The resulting selection of personal and collective moments
  that are otherwise lost in the flood presents an alternative model of online attention
  based on a common pattern of language—it is both archive and accumulation.
