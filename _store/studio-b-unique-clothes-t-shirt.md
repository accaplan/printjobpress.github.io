description: Studio B's first clothing item, the Unique Clothes T-Shirt is produced
  in a handful of color combinations based on UNIQLO's packaged T-Shirts. These color
  pairs are hand picked and sewn and are produced in an initial limited edition of
  four. They are an exercise in found color combinations, but as clothing. We suggest
  <a href="http://kmbag.nl/" title="">KMbag</a> as a complementary accessory for the
  shirt. Other color combinations are available per request via <a href="mailto:ericyoungli@gmail.com"
  title="">email</a>.<br><br>The Studio B Unique Clothes collection is based on off
  clothing purchasable at UNIQLO. Originally founded in 1984 as "Unique Clothing Warehouse,"
  an administrative error caused the firm to be registered not as UNICLO but instead
  as UNIQLO. Since then, the fast retail, fast fashion company has gone on to produce
  clothing that is anything but unique. In fact, mass production and mechanization
  has perhaps led to a new definition of the term unique. Studio B is interested in
  perusing UNIQLO's various wares and creating clothing that is perhaps, somewhat
  unique.<br><br>Studio B is the collaborative workshop of Eric Li and Kelly Tan.
