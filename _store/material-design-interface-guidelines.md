description: Material Design Interface Guidelines was created by Jonathan Zong at
  the Lewis Center for the Arts, Princeton University, in Fall 2016. <br><br>The photographs
  were made by capturing light passing through sheets of acrylic onto a canvas. They
  are titled after the Material design specification, Google:&nbsp;<a href="http://material.google.com/">material.google.com</a>.<br><br>Each
  photograph is an interface guideline, a set of principled recommendations for the
  implementation of an interactive system.
