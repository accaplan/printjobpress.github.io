description: This project consists of a year-long serialization with a new issue every
  Thursday. Each booklet displays just one piece of content pertaining to everyday
  life, and the topic could be focused around the cultural objects that we consume,
  clothes that we wear, and/or childhood memories that we hold. Content usually revolves
  around fashion, female adolescence, consuming East Asian pop culture or cultural
  products. Occasionally, content will be submitted by other writers, but they will
  all be written and illustrated by hand under the Pink Label aesthetic.&nbsp;The
  zine pages are printed on two 8.5x11 inch paper front and back, folded, and cut
  to create a small sixteen-page booklet that easily fits in your hand. With this
  accessible publishing method, the zines can cheaply be reproduced using a standard
  copy machine.<br><br>Purchase and get a random issue from the series, or request
  a specific issue by emailing helenlinart@gmail.com.
