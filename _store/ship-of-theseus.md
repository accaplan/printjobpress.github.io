description: I did this booklet as the written report for my independent work with
  David Reinfurt, on time. And its kind of my first stab at design writing, which
  is like this entire field of writing that concerns design in a very broad sense.
  So often design writing isn't actually about graphic design details but sort of
  broader ideas that can influence design thinking. And itsâ€“ the format is loosely
  inspired by things I had seen written by different authors in *Bulletins of the
  Serving Library* and *Dot Dot Dot* and its kind of meant to be like the a discussion
  on time, ideas about design and identity overall. And it has little to do with my
  actual independent work which is the uhm exploration of different watch faces for
  the Apple Watch. To the extent that there is kind of two competing pieces in here.
  One is the text, which is kind of just a general or a specific I guess discussion
  of design, identity, and sort of thinking about this idea of true form that Max
  Bill proposed in his essay *<em>ontinuity and Change*</em> uh so there's that and
  there's also the images which are uh screenshots of each different watch face I
  designed throughout the semester. And what I kind of like about it is that the two
  are actually really uh intricately linked in that each image corresponds to what
  I'm talking about at any given point. But uh there's kind of this unresolved like
  like there's lack of clarity that I like because it kind of forces the reader to
  dig in and try to understand why are these images of watch faces being talked about
  in this discussion of time and design.
