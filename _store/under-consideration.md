description: <em><br></em><a href="http://under-consideration.com/" title=""><em>Under
  Consideration</em></a>&nbsp;is a collaborative publishing effort by&nbsp;<a href="http://nazli-ercan.com/">Nazli
  Ercan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://eric.young.li/">Eric Li</a>.<br><br>This
  project is a container for an exchange of ideas between one another. Each new entry
  on this site is a response to the previous entry by the other author; it is the
  next thought of a continuous conversation. In this regard, the entries themselves
  become the medium in this unending collaborative process. The logo, like its contents,
  is also subject to continuous updating and revisioning. The two curved lines signify
  each participant. One is solid, which corresponds to the person who last responded,
  while the other is dotted, waiting for the other to respond. Once a response is
  added, the lines flip and the solid becomes dotted while the dotted becomes solid.
