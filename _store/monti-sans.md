description: Monti Sans is a typeface meant to explore how institutions deploy graphic
  design in order to assert their own authority. Monti Sans is inspired by James Goggin's
  Courier Sans, and is created by taking Princeton's typeface, Monticello, and cutting
  off all the serifs with an exacto knife. This booklet functions as a specimen book
  and collects all the research that went into the typeface and ties it together with
  a short text.
