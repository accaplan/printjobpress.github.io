description: Monti Sans was developed as part of Fia Backstrom’s Art as Research class.
  I was interested in exploring the idea of a font as an archive; much like how photographs
  and documents are considered archives, I argued that fonts can also be considered
  archival material. This project began by researching the history of Princeton Monticello
  and Princeton’s identity, the results of which can be found here.
